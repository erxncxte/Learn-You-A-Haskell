-- To make a list containing all the natural numbers from 1 to 20, you can use ..
numbers = [1..20]
-- Will output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]

-- This will also work with the alphabet
alphabet = ['a'..'z']
-- Will output: [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]

-- You can also specify a step
stepThis = [2,4..20]
-- Will output: [2,4,5,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
